```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

Welcome! This is an introductory post which I'll use to explain my motivations for starting this blog, acclimate myself with the functionality that Jekyll's 'Minimal Mistakes' theme provides, and provide details on what you can expect here within the next few weeks.

## Motivations



### Current Lack of Online Presence



### Offsetting Any Accumulated Cognitive Debt

Talking points: lack of writing that you're doing nowadays, evidence of cognitive debt attribtued to frequent LLM use,


### Lack of Familiarity with Git
