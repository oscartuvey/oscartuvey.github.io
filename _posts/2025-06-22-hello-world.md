```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

Welcome! This is an introductory post which I'll use to explain my motivations for starting this blog, acclimate myself with the functionality that Jekyll's 'Minimal Mistakes' theme provides, and provide details on what you can expect here within the next few weeks.

## Motivations

### Current Lack of Online Presence

### Offsetting Accrued Cognitive Debt
It's time to admit: I've developed an over-reliance on LLMs to produce much of my daily writing. What started as a means of efficiently drafting emails has devolved into prompting for Slack messages offering my thanks. Perhaps unsurprisingly, [the use of large language models is contributing to an accumulation of cognitive debt amongst its users](https://www.media.mit.edu/publications/your-brain-on-chatgpt/). As a means of combating any debt I've already accrued, I'll be instituting a strict no-LLM policy: at no point am I allowed to use any LLMs for any writing or research purposes in this blog.

## What to Expect

### Mechanistic Interpretability

Over the past several months, I've developed a significant interest in mechanistic interpretability: the study of reverse-engineering neural network's internal components to understand the reasoning behind their outputs. Google DeepMind's Neel Nanda offers a handy [introductory course to mechanistic interpretability](https://www.neelnanda.io/mechanistic-interpretability/getting-started)
