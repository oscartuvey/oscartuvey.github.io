```python

Welcome! This is an introductory post which I'll use to explain my motivations for starting my blog, acclimate myself with the functionality that Jekyll's 'Minimal Mistakes' theme provides, and provide details on what you can expect here within the next few weeks.

## Motivations

### Current Lack of Online Presence

### Offsetting Any Accumulated Cognitive Debt

### Lack of Familiarity with Git
