I am a fourth-year MEng Computer Science undergraduate at the University of Liverpool. During my studies, I have completed three academic exchanges: two at the University of Toronto (one semester and one full year), and one at the University of British Columbia, where I participated in the Visiting International Research Student program.

I'm deeply interested in mechanistic interpretability and, more broadly, the challenge of aligning powerful AI systems with human intent. My current focus is on large language models: how they work under the hood, what kinds of internal computations they perform, and whether their outputs reflect genuine reasoning or merely pattern completion. I aim to better understand the mechanisms behind their behavior to help build systems that are more transparent, predictable, and aligned.
