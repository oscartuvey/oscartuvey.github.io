Hi, I’m Oscar Tuvey — an undergraduate student in Computer Science at the University of Liverpool, currently completing a Research and Development Placement at [Kwalee](https://www.kwalee.com/).
I’m an aspiring researcher with a particular interest in mechanistic interpretability, and more broadly in understanding how large language models internally represent and process information — particularly in relation to how these processes align with broader theories of human cognition.
